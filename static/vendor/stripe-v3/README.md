# Stripe js

It's a copy of a script from `https://js.stripe.com/v3/` for use in a dev mode locally.

See scripts section in the template `dds_registration/templates/base-core.html.django`.

Script check if it was loaded from the original site or not. So, probably, it's pointless to keep this local version.
